# All Cubes Mod

Your cube is tired of being neglected by all the other Geometry Dash gamemodes. In 1.0 it was the go-to, and now, it's the left side bench warmer. However, this mod can fix that. Every gamemode now looks like your cube. The ship will still function as a ship, but it will look like a cube and fit to the ship's actual hitbox.

You can enable and disable specific gamemodes being a cube in the Icon kit (be warned this does NOT save when you close and open the game).
Additional cosmetic settings are in this Mod's settings page.

This mod is a complete joke lmao.
